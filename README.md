This repository contains the HTML, CSS and JS files of an interactive and functional dice game

The rules of the game are:
1. Input player one's and two's names which will be displayed in the game.
2. Roll dice continuously until current score is sufficient for you.
3. Hold the current score which will be displayed on the main score board.
4. This will be done interchangeably between two plaayers until a player gets 100 as his main score. In that case, he wins.

N.B: When the dice shows 1, the current score would be lost and the turn will be passed to next player.
